      <p>Welcome to my page!!! I am a rising Senior double-majoring in Computer Science and 
          Psychology at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am originally from Virginia, 
          but both my parents are Nigerian immigrants who came to the States in 1994 (more on this 
          later). I <strong>LOVE</strong> music and am an avid concert goer. One of the most 
          breathtaking experiences of my life was seeing the Northern Lights in northern Norway 
          this past February. <a href="animals.html">Here</a> are some pictures from some random 
          animal experiences over the past year.</p>
