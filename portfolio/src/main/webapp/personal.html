          I am originally from Virginia, but both my parents are Nigerian immigrants who 
          came to the States in 1994. I have an older brother, younger sister, and enough 
          first cousins to count on all 4 limbs (second cousins gets into the hundreds). I 
          <strong>LOVE</strong> music and am an avid concert goer, averaging 7 annually for 
          the past few years. One of the most breathtaking experiences of my life was 
          seeing the Northern Lights in northern Norway this past February.

          experiences over the past year.
