      <h1>Welcome to the professional side of Tomi!</h1>
      <p>
          I am a rising senior double majoring in Computer Science and Psychology at the 
          University of Maryland, College Park. While at college, I have been part of a 
          multiple high school recruitment events through the Computer Science and Honors 
          departments. In 2019 I organized <a href="https://bit.camp/">Bitcamp</a> and 
          volunteered at <a href="https://gotechnica.org/">Technica</a>, 2 hackathons 
          organized and run by UMD students.
